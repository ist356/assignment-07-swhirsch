## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

Through Assignment 7, I practiced webscraping, cleaning scraped data, and more. In MenuItemExtractor.py, I practice conditional importing of data and the cleaning/modification of scraped data. These are vital skills to know when scraping data from websites, which tend to vary in formating. In tully_scraper.py, I scrape data from the Tully's wesbite, and ensure the proper data from the website is being exported to VSCode. 


In Assignment 7 I practiced webscraping data and cleaning newly scraped data for analysis of information. In MenuItemExtractor.py, I practiced importing data with conditions and cleaning the new data. These skills are very important, as data scrapped from the web tend to hold different formings. In tully_scraper.py, I scraped data from the Tully's website to ensure the menu was being properly transported into VScode.
